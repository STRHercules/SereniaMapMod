# This is an attempt at making a map "endless".

## Map Construction

Inlaid Library has been edited and added as a whole new map; Chaotic Library. Default to unlock this map is to achieve level 100 as any character in 'The Bone Zone'.

I have expanded the Library to inculde the upper and lower sections as explorable areas. These are connected now and allow the player to travel infinitely north and south, as well as east and west.

I have also placed numerous pickups around the map, verying on the x and y axis varying distances away from spawn. They range from as close as 2 tilesets away for a Vacuum to 30+ for an evolved weapon. 

## Monsters

I have done this by removing the Death Event at the 30 minute marker, as well as removing the 'wipe' event that happens at 30 minutes. I then extended the, what I call 'minute markers', from 30 all the way to 130 minutes. 

From 30-60 Minutes I have transposed the waved from The Bone Zone. Initially at 30 minutes the 'Library' waves would end and then the 'Bone Zone' waves would begin. I found this to be somewhat of a jarring change of pace, so I took the 'minute markers' of 1-20 minutes, copied them to be 'minute markers' of the Chaotic Libraries' 30-50 Minutes. I then added additional monsters to these waves. Effectively creating a somewhat more 'even' monster curve from 20-60 minutes.

Once the player reaches 60 minutes, the waves are completely replaced every 10 minutes until 130 minutes. These waves are custom and consist mainly of 'XL' and 'Boss' monsters.

At wave 130, the final wave is determined, which is a massive pool of potential enemies. This set of enemies will then spawn indefinitely.
